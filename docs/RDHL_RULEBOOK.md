II. RESPONSIBILITIES
This is intended to be a fun league and not a job, therefore the minimum participation requirements are intentionally low. Making trades, participating in contests, voting and general discussion are always encouraged, but never required. Checking in on the discord as often as possible is also encouraged to ensure you are keeping up with league activity, there are no hard requirements though. 

As there are some rules that are not enforced automatically, respectfully reminding GMs of the rules if you notice a violation is strongly encouraged to ensure there is a level playing field.

Participation in the entry draft and waiver draft is mandatory, as is maintaining a compliant roster of active players and setting lineups. If you fail to participate in the mandatory parts of the league you run the risk of action against your team according to IX. TANKING or X. INACTIVE TEAMS.



III. ELIGIBILITY
Only hockey players meeting one the following requirements as confirmed by information on Fantrax or EliteProspects are eligible for ownership in this league:

Players whose rights belong to an NHL team (drafted or signed)

The prospect roster (also called minors) consists of up to 60 prospects of any position. Prospects cannot be used in a scoring capacity unless they are promoted to your active roster first. Prospects who are called up to the active roster do not count towards your prospect limit, but do count toward your active roster limit.

VI. SEASON
TLDR: Top 8 teams by win-loss record eligible for playoffs. Roster freezes for teams not active in playoffs. Strict player limits during the regular season and playoffs that are relaxed in the offseason after the entry draft.

A season is the period between the conclusion of two RDHL Championship Matchups and is broken down into the following periods.
A. Roster Freezes
At any time and for any reason the Committee may decide to implement a roster freeze for any roster or rosters.
No transactions of any kind may be made involving rosters in a freeze.
Any posts in any of the transaction channels involving a frozen roster or transactions executed on Fantrax are invalid and subject to reversal.
B. Offseason
There will be an active and prospect roster freeze until Fantrax officially starts the new season.
Once the playoffs have finished, all teams must activate their IR, suspended, waived and Inactive players. All prospects that have graduated to players and waived players, must be called up to the main roster from the minors. All prospects, on the main roster, must be sent down to the minors, as they will count towards your prospect limit, even if they are on your main roster.
No team can have over 34 players at the start of the offseason. You cannot add players to get yourself up to the 34 player limit. It is only in place to cover players already on your roster that are currently on active roster, on your IR, and prospects that have graduated to players
No team can have over 65 prospects after the entry draft. You cannot add prospects to get yourself up to the 60 prospect limit. It is only in place to cover prospects already in your minors and the prospects you pick in the entry draft.
There will be a deadline to get back down to the 24 players and 60 prospect limit for next season set during the offseason once the next season’s schedule is announced.
GM's can assign injured players to IR and call-up prospects once training camp begins in September. Teams have until one week prior to the start of the NHL regular season to be roster compliant.
C. Regular Season
Teams play a series of one week long Head-to-Head matchups as determined by random draw irrespective of Conference.
The regular season will take place over the weeks of the season that are not reserved for playoffs or otherwise blocked off.
The top 8 teams after the last matchup of the season will be eligible for the playoffs.
Standing are based on regular season head-to-head record with any ties broken by the following tiebreakers in order
Most fantasy points for the entire season
Head-to-head record vs. all teams tied with
Best division record for the entire season
Most wins in entire season
D. Playoffs
8 teams will advance to the playoffs. The playoffs commence with the quarter-finals and will last 6 weeks. Each round will last 2 weeks. The team that wins in all 3 rounds wins the RDHL Stanley Cup Championship.
Playoffs commence 6 weeks before the final week of the season so that the final week of our playoffs is the 2nd last week of the NHL regular season. This is to avoid players being healthy scratched to prepare for the NHL playoffs, which could put teams in our league at significant disadvantage.
A roster freeze on players will be in effect for non-playoff teams starting at the end of the regular season. Prospects may still be added/dropped.
Playoff seeding will be determined by the regular season standings with the 1 seed going to the team with the best record in the regular season and the 8 seed to the team with the worst record making the playoffs. This is assuming no inactive teams make the playoffs. See XI. INACTIVE TEAMS
After each round teams are reseeded. This means the highest remaining seed will always play the lowest, and the next highest plays the next lowest, and so on.. 


VII. TRANSACTIONS
All transactions must be posted in the correct thread on the RDHL Discord. Any disputes will be resolved using the timestamps and order on the RDHL Discord (eg. if there is a player/prospect claim in dispute, the claim that was posted on the correct Discord channel first is entitled to that claim). Daily adds/drops begin at 1:00 am E.S.T/10:00 pm P.S.T./5:00 am G.M.T.
A. Add/Drop (Players/Prospects)
TLDR: 1 prospect add per day max. 1 player add per day max outside of unlimited IR Replacements. Unlimited drops. Post all adds and drops in Discord

Teams may add and drop players and prospects from the eligible player pool with the following limits outside of roster freezes. 
Add 1 player to active roster per day
Add any number of IR replacements to active roster per day (see D. Injured Reserve/Suspensions)
Add 1 minors eligible player to prospect roster per day
Drop any number of players from either roster per day
All adds and drops must be players or prospects not owned by another RDHL team and must be posted in the appropriate discord channel
#add-drop-players for active roster
#add-drop-prospects for prospect roster.
Moving a player to IR does not need a discord post unless intending to use an IR replacement Add/Promotion.
Adding players for IR replacements do not count towards your 1 add per day. Players added as IR replacements must be indicated as such in the discord post.
You may drop any number of players per day outside of roster freeze periods.
All players added on Discord must be added by the GM on Fantrax within 24 hours of posting on Discord. Failure to do so renders the add claim null and void, and means the added player or prospect is returned to the free agent pool, free to be added by another team.
Players not in the Fantrax database at the time of the add are exempt from the 24 hour restriction. If this occurs, the GM making the claim MUST note in the post that the said prospect is not available in Fantrax. The adding GM will request the player in Fantrax (reach out to the commissioner for help if needed), and then add that player to their roster once available on Fantrax.
Any player or prospect who is added must remain on a roster for at least 5 days beginning with the first day/night of games that player is eligible for scoring. The 5-day restriction applies to all added players and prospects including IR replacements.
Prospects whose rights belong to an NHL team (drafted or signed), those who were eligible for the most recently completed Entry Draft, or anyone 19 years or older can be added.
B. Trades
TLDR: May trade anything but waiver draft picks, must be posted on discord and confirmed by the GM that didn’t post.

Players, prospects, and/or draft picks may be traded in this league. You may not trade Waiver Draft Picks.
One GM of the trade must post the terms of the deal in the "Trades" thread under transactions. All terms of the deal including players/prospects/draft picks or conditions must be posted. The other GM in the deal must confirm the deal in reply.
Conditional trades should allow a team to benefit based on the condition being met. The condition should not be used to revert the trade after a specified time period, having allowed another team to benefit during this time (i.e. player rentals). Conditions will be subject to review by the commissioner panel.
Conditional Trades should only consist of picks that you already have. If you do not have access to the pick, then you can not conditionally trade it.
Conditions must be quantifiable based on a player's or team's performance over the course of a season, e.g. "a player scores more than X points" or "a team finishes in the top 10".
Trade deadline is TBD. There will be a trade freeze in effect until after the Waiver Draft.
C. Minor League Transactions
TLDR: 1 prospect promotion outside of IR replacements. Only skaters with less than 101 games and goalies with less than 51 games are eligible to be sent to minors without having to go through waivers.

Every team is allowed to promote 1 prospect per day (teams may demote more than 1 if necessary). 
Promoting prospects for IR replacements do not count towards your 1 promotion per day limit. Players promoted as IR replacements must be indicated as such in the discord post. 
An open roster spot on your active roster at the time of promotion is required.
Any prospect who is called up must remain on the active roster for at least 5 days beginning with the first day/night of games that prospect is eligible for scoring.
Prospects demoted from their NHL team in real life are exempt from this limit.
The maximum number of games that can be played across all seasons while still being considered a prospect is 100 for Skaters and 50 for Goalies.
Prospects who play their 101st game (forwards/defencemen); 51st game (goalies) are automatically promoted to active players when on your active roster.
Prospects who play their 101st game (forwards/defencemen); 51st game (goalies) while on your prospect roster may remain on your prospect roster until the end of the season or until promoted to active roster at which point they are no longer considered a prospect and are subject to all non-prospect rules including waivers.
D. Injured Reserve/Suspensions
Any player marked as injured or suspended on Fantrax is eligible to be placed on IR
Injured or suspended players/prospects who are assigned to injured reserve do not count against the 24 man limit. 
Players added or promoted as IR replacements do count towards limits while on the active roster just the same as non-IR replacements. Any player or prospect who is added as a replacement must still abide by the rules set out in A. Add/Drop (Players/Prospects) and C. Minor League Transactions
An injured prospect may be moved to IR, but will still count towards the prospect limit.
E. Player Waivers
To submit a player for waivers, please post the player’s full name in the correct discord channel #waivers, and a commissioner will move them to your prospect roster. If 24 hours have passed and no other GM has claimed the player, they will remain on your prospect roster, but are not considered a prospect or waivers exempt.
Waived players will count towards your prospect limit immediately. You should make room for a waived player before posting the waiver as the Commissioner will only move the player to your prospect roster, it is on the GM submitting the waiver to ensure roster compliance.
In order to put a claim on a waived player, you need to quote the post in #waivers of the player you want. Once 24 hours have passed, the Committee will determine which team has the successful waiver claim, and will add the player to your roster. (Please remind the Committee if the 24 hours has passed and the waiver has not been processed)
Waiver rankings will be decided based on the current standings from week 5 onward. During the off-season and for the first 4 weeks of the regular season, waiver order will be based off of the prior season’s final standings. The last place team will always have the first chance to claim a player off of waivers. Waivers are reset after each matchup period has concluded. 
Waivers will be available during the entire regular season and closed for playoffs. Waivers will reopen during the off-season following the waiver draft and lifting of the roster freeze.


VIII. DRAFTS
During the drafts we're asking each GM to do 3 things as far as commitment goes: 
Have a list of potential picks ready to go BEFORE it is your turn to pick.
Check in as much as possible
Ensure that you will receive a notification if pinged directly
After making your pick, ping the next GM on the clock so they know it is their turn to pick
Make your selection as soon as possible when on the clock. If you are trying to trade your pick please do so in a timely manner (ideally before you are on the clock).
A. Waiver Draft
The league will hold a waiver draft two weeks after the end of our regular season. The waiver draft will consist of 2 rounds. All non-playoff teams will draft based on the reverse order of the final standings.
All teams are required to protect 18 players from their active roster. Any unprotected player will then be eligible to be claimed in the waiver draft. Any team that wishes to protect 3 or more goalies may do so, but each goalie protected results in losing 1 protected player spot (e.g. protecting 3 goalies results in 17 spots total, protecting 4 goalies results in 16 spots total, etc.)
Every team must post a roster of protected and unprotected players in the Waiver Draft thread.
Waiver draft picks are NOT eligible for trade.
Prospects are automatically protected from form the waiver draft.
The trade freeze will be in effect through the Waiver Draft.
There will be a total roster freeze 1 week prior to the waiver draft. No trades, player claims or prospect claims will be permitted during this time.
A team may only lose a total of 2 players during the waiver draft. Once said team has been chosen from 2 times, those players will no longer be able to be selected and stay on your roster for next season.
The draft order works the same way as the Entry Draft. This is not serpentine.
You cannot draft players from your own team.
B. Entry Draft
TLDR: 5 rounds of 20 picks, first 2 overall picks subject to a lottery open to non-playoff teams. 24 hours to pick but please try to go quicker than that. Only players drafted in the most recent NHL entry draft are eligible

The Entry Draft will consist of 5 rounds of 20 picks each.
The Base Draft order will be the inverse of the standings for teams not reaching the playoff, and the order of elimination for teams in the playoffs with higher scoring teams picking later (last place team going first, champion going last, championship loser going 2nd to last, highest score of teams eliminated in the semi-finals going 3rd to last, etc.) and will apply to all rounds besides the first.
The first round draft order will be the base draft order with picks of non-playoff teams being eligible to move up in the lottery.
The RDHL Entry Draft Lottery for the first overall pick will involve the bottom 12 teams (non-playoff teams).
The entry draft lottery involves pulling out the numbers from the basket/hat/bowl/etc, and whichever team has been assigned the 6 digit number that the balls produce wins the lottery. (note: the order in which the balls are selected matters)
The same process will be used to determine the team picking second overall. If a combination belonging to the pick already selected for first overall is pulled in the second draw, the selection will be made again until a new pick is selected.
A team can only drop a max of 2 draft positions in the entry draft lottery. Only the first two draft positions slots are up for grabs by the percentages below.


A team winning the lottery will be determined by using permutations for 6 numbers (ping pong balls), to come up with a set of 720 unique permutations. The permutations are:

No.   Permutation
1     123456
2     123465
3     123546
4     123564
5     123645
...   ...
716   654132
717   654213
718   654231
719   654312
720   654321



Using the full set of 6 numbers gives us these percentages which are applied to the teams eligible for the lottery in reverse standings order (pick originally belonging to last place team gets 28.5% chance, pick originally belonging to the team closest to making the playoffs gets 0.6%):

No. Range  Count  Odds
1-205      205    28.5%
206-360    155    21.5%
361-479    119    16.5%
480-558    79     11.0%
559-612    54     7.5%
613-644    32     4.4%
645-666    22     3.1%
667-684    18     2.5%
685-698    14     1.9%
699-709    11     1.5%
710-716    7      1.0%
717-720    4      0.6%

All prospects drafted must be players who were drafted that respective year in the NHL Entry Draft (eg. 2024 NHL Entry Draft). All drafted players count towards your prospect limit immediately.
If a GM fails to make a valid pick in the appropriate draft channel within the time limit, it is considered a missed pick and dropped exactly 1 round. All picks between the two positions are moved up 1 position. (e.g. pick 5 overall becomes pick 25 overall, picks 6-25 all move up a spot). If the same pick is missed again, it will be forfeited permanently.
If a trade is made involving a draft pick, the GM acquiring the pick will be granted 8 hours from the time of the transaction in order to make their selection.
Single picks from the same year cannot be traded during the draft (eg. 21st overall for 26th overall) as one team clearly benefits and the other does not. Either lower picks, or picks/players/prospects or players/prospects must accompany all trades involving a draft pick made during the draft.
Please message a committee member if you believe you may be unable to make any of your upcoming selections within the time limit. Providing a list of your preferred selections will allow the committee to make the pick on your behalf and avoid your pick dropping as detailed above in point six.
There will be a prospect roster freeze for the duration of the draft commencing 24 hours prior to the start of the draft. No prospect transactions are allowed during this time. 
The prospect freeze will be lifted after the draft at a time of the commissioners choosing. At this point normal rules regarding prospect transactions (including daily transaction limits and prospect eligibility) will go into effect.
C. Dispersal Draft

The Dispersal draft will be broken into two parts. 
The Player Dispersal Draft for players not meeting the qualifications to be a prospect from the teams being dispersed. 
The Prospect and Draft Pick Dispersal Draft.
Both drafts will be snake format. The first pick of the Player Dispersal Draft will be selected at random and the Prospect and Draft Pick Dispersal Draft will have the reverse order.
In the player draft, all GMs must first fill their active rosters (12 Forwards, 6 Defensemen, 2 Goalies) if possible before selecting their last 4 bench spots. 
If a team is left with roster spots that are unable to be filled by the players remaining in the dispersal draft they will be awarded 1 additional bench spot per unfillable roster spot. (If there are no goalies left, but a team still has one open active goalie position then they will get an extra bench spot to draft a skater into)
All players not selected in this draft will go into free agency.
In the prospect dispersal draft, all GMs must fill all prospect slots if possible. Once all prospect slots are full only draft picks may be selected.
After the dispersal draft takes place, the new GMs will be allowed to participate in the Waiver Draft in the last draft positions, with the same order as they picked in the first round of the Player Dispersal Draft.
The Dispersal Draft should conclude before the Entry Draft for the year starts.


IX. INACTIVE PLAYERS
If a player/prospect who is signed to an NHL contract while on a team's roster retires, signs a contract to play outside the NHL or goes unsigned, a team retains his rights for 1 year without that player counting towards the roster limits. Teams may request the player be moved to their Injured Reserve on Fantrax. 
You cannot add an inactive player to your roster. Players may only become inactive while on an RDHL roster.
You can trade the rights of an inactive player. If an inactive player is traded their 1 year of eligibility is reset.


X. TANKING
TLDR: You must at all times field the most competitive team you can with the players you have

There will be a three strike warning process when it comes to tanking. Tanking may include, but is not limited to the following:

Not setting daily line-ups
Leaving active players in reserve when there are open active roster spots
Benching productive players in favour of unproductive or replacement level players
Not using all 24 roster positions
Not calling up productive prospects in lieu of unproductive or replacement level players
Not calling up a productive prospect over an unproductive prospect
Rostering players without immediate or future fantasy relevance

A strike will be issued if a majority of the committee agrees to it.
If you are given three strikes, your best pick in the draft will automatically be pushed to the end of its round. Example: If you have the #3 overall pick but have three strikes it is moved to the end of round one, becoming the #20 overall pick.
Strikes will be public knowledge. When a GM receives a strike the committee will update the discord to reflect.
One strike will be removed from your record if you have 18 months without an infraction.


XI. INACTIVE TEAMS
TLDR: Inactive teams will have their GMs replaced immediately in preseason or the first half of the regular season, otherwise after playoffs conclude. Dispersal draft if at least 2 inactive teams when the playoffs end.

Inactive designations are the discretion of the committee and can be for any reason.
If the season is less than halfway over, the committee will replace the GM of the inactive team immediately.
If the season is more than halfway over, the GM of the inactive team will not be replaced immediately. The committee will be responsible for setting lineups for the remainder of the season.
The committee will not make any add, drop, trade or waiver transactions for the inactive team. The committee will only ensure lineups are set, and on the first day of any matchup that IR eligible players are placed on IR and replaced with prospects active in the NHL. If there are no eligible prospects then the IR eligible player shall remain on the roster.
If at the end of the season, there is only one inactive team, a new GM for the team will be recruited by the committee. If at the end of the season, there are two or more inactive teams a new GM for each of the inactive teams will be recruited by the committee and the players, prospects, and picks of all inactive teams will enter a Dispersal Draft. See C. Dispersal Draft
Any inactive team making playoffs will be ineligible to compete for the Championship, but will not be replaced in the playoffs. They will occupy the lowest seeds regardless of record and will be considered bye matchups for whatever team would face them. Regular standings rules still apply to active teams.
The draft picks of inactive teams that make the playoffs, but do not compete, will not be eligible for the lottery and will take position in the base draft order as the first teams eliminated from the playoffs (of any order as the picks will be dispersed). 


XII. VOTING
A league votes must be posted in the discord channel #the-courthouse, and only the committee may post a vote.
All league votes require 50% of voting GMs to approve and at least 8 GMs voting.
All league votes must be open for at least 48 hours. Any league vote open less than 2 weeks requires a league-wide ping to ensure members are informed that a vote is open.
Members are free to discuss votes in the #general channel. If there is enough discussion that the #general channel becomes less usable for its normal purpose; consider creating a separate channel just for discussing the vote.
Commissioners may clarify a vote in the #the-courthouse, however if the clarification changes the nature of the vote it should be removed and reposted as a new vote.
XIII. CONTESTS
At any point during the season the commissioners may decide to initiate a contest open to all GMs in the league.
The contest format and scoring is at the discretion of the commissioners, but is subject to vote if requested by at least 1 GM. See XI. VOTING for detail.
XIV. RULE CHANGES
Rule changes may be proposed by anyone, but will require at least one other member backing the proposal for a vote to be initiated.
Rule change votes are subject to normal voting rules. See XI. VOTING for detail.
