AI Team Playbook
1. Product Manager (Vision → Backlog)
Tools: Claude (Opus/Sonnet), ChatGPT (if available)
Input: High-level goal (feature, product idea, bug report).
Ask:
Break this into epics → stories → tasks.
Include acceptance criteria.
Prioritize tasks (P0, P1, P2).
Output: A backlog you can “hand down” to your engineer agents.
Example prompt:
“Act as my product manager. I want to add a login flow to my app. Break this into developer tasks with acceptance criteria and testing notes.”

2. Tech Lead (Architecture & Scaffolding)
Tools: Claude Code, ChatGPT, or Cursor in explain/planning mode
Input: A chosen task from the PM.
Ask:
Suggest architecture / design patterns.
Identify dependencies, risks, edge cases.
Generate scaffolding (empty classes, functions, file layout).
Output: Skeleton code + design notes.
📝 Example prompt:
“You’re the tech lead. For the login flow, propose file structure, outline classes/functions, and note security risks to address.”

3. Engineer (Implementation)
Tools: Jules (background async), Cursor (interactive pair programmer)
Input: Scaffolding and task.
Ask:
Jules: “Generate implementation for this module and unit tests.”
Cursor: Iterate interactively, fix errors, adapt output to the repo.
Output: Working code + tests.


📝 Example prompt for Jules:
“Write the full implementation for auth_service.py using JWT-based sessions. Include error handling and at least 3 unit tests.”

4. QA Engineer (Testing & Validation)
Tools: Cursor, Claude, Bugbot (optional)
Input: Implemented feature.
Ask:


Generate additional test cases (happy path, edge cases, failure modes).
Run/debug tests.
Suggest improvements to make code more robust.
Output: Expanded test suite + QA notes.
📝 Example prompt:
“Act as QA. Generate edge-case tests for the login flow (expired token, malformed input, SQL injection attempt).”

5. You (Director)
Keep your focus on vision and integration:
Make sure the PM → Tech Lead → Engineer → QA pipeline flows.
Step in when agents stall or hallucinate.
Decide priorities and when “good enough” is good enough.

Workflow Checklist
Define Vision → PM agent makes backlog.
Choose a Task → Tech Lead agent plans architecture.
Delegate Implementation → Engineer agent (Jules) builds it.
Refine & Debug → Pair with Cursor to fix gaps.
Run QA → Testing agent expands coverage.
Review & Ship → You approve, integrate, move on.

📌 Pro tip: Don’t try to automate the handoffs yet. Treat each role as a station you walk the task through. Later, when orchestration tools mature, you’ll just replace the manual steps with automated flows — but your management style will already be solid.
